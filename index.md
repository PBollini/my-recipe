### Tacos de Barbacoa (Slow-Cooked, Juicy, Tender)

Serves: 4–6
Cooking: 3–4 hours (oven or slow cooker)

### Ingredients 🧾 
For the meat

- 1.2–1.5 kg beef chuck, beef cheek, or lamb shoulder (all work beautifully)

- 1 white onion, quartered

- 5 garlic cloves, peeled

- 2 bay leaves

- Salt & pepper

For the adobo marinade

- 4 dried guajillo chiles

- 2 dried ancho chiles (optional but recommended)

- 1–2 chipotles in adobo (from a can — Albert Heijn has them!)

- 2 tsp ground cumin

- 1 tsp dried oregano

- 1 tsp smoked paprika

- ½ tsp ground cloves (tiny pinch)

- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar

- 1 cup beef broth

### To serve

- Warm corn tortillas

- White onion, finely chopped

- Fresh coriander

- Limes

- Optional: salsa verde, pickled red onions

### Instructions 🥣
1️⃣ Prep the chiles

- Remove stems and seeds from the dried chiles.

- Pour boiling water over them and let soak 15 minutes till soft.

2️⃣ Make the adobo

- Blend together:

- soaked chiles

- chipotles

- garlic

- spices

- vinegar

- beef broth

→ You want a thick, brick-red sauce that smells intense and smoky.

3️⃣ Marinate the meat

- Rub the meat generously with salt and pepper.
- Coat it with the adobo.
- Let sit 30 min (or up to overnight in the fridge).

4️⃣ Slow-cook it

- Pick one method:

- Oven (recommended for good texture):

- Place meat + marinade + onion + bay leaves in a Dutch oven.

- Cover tightly.

- Bake at 150°C for 3½ hours, until the meat collapses when you poke it.

- Slow cooker:

- Low for 7–8 hours, or high for 4–5 hours.

- Pressure cooker (quickest):

- 1 hour at high pressure, natural release 15 min.

5️⃣ Shred + crisp (optional but amazing)

- Shred the meat with two forks.
- If you want the “taco truck” vibe:

Pan-fry a portion in its own juices until slightly crispy on the edges.

6️⃣ Assemble the tacos

W- arm tortillas → add barbacoa → top with onion, coriander, and a squeeze of lime.

### Heaven.

🔥 Bonus: simple salsa verde (5 min)

1 jar AH tomatillos (they actually have them!) or substitute mini green tomatoes.

1 garlic clove

Salt
Blend. Done.

Enjoy!!
